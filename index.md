## Struggling to stream ¬£9250 Netflix to your top floor room in Selly? Need better WiFi?

This post got me banned from fab 'n' fresh for some unknown reason, but hey, we move. I haven't been paid by TP-Link for this and I don't make money off it in any way, I just hate to see people struggling with WiFi ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Have had a couple of messages asking for WiFi help so thought I‚Äôd just write up what‚Äôs worked for us in out 9 room house w/ Virgin

The router (wifi box) that Virgin give you is a bit crap, it might be okay for a family of four but it‚Äôs really not designed for 6+ zooming students. So the first thing you probably want to do is replace it with something a bit better, we got a [TP-Link Archer A7](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Archer-A7-Wireless-Combined-Supports/dp/B00416PTDW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=tp-link+archer+a7&qid=1603798306&sr=8-1) (currently about ¬£65 on Amazon) and it‚Äôs been great, quite easy to setup and use too. I was sceptical at first about spending on a router when it seemed to just be the WiFi that‚Äôs the issue (which is just one of the router‚Äôs responsibilities) but several fellow geeks have assured me this was necessary and it definitely has worked for us.

  

Note that if you do ‚Äòreplace‚Äô the virgin router, you still need to use it as a modem (basically converts internet from the wall into Ethernet) and connect it to the new router, with a (long) Ethernet cable. Putting the router in modem mode is pretty easy, instructions below. You‚Äôll still be getting your internet from Virgin, paying them monthly etc. You‚Äôd just be repurposing their box to just pass along internet traffic to your new router, it won‚Äôt do WiFi or anything any more. [Tutorial here](https://www.virginmedia.com/help/virgin-media-hub-modem-mode)

  

You might also want to put the new router on the middle floor of your house to give better coverage of top floor rooms, and to do this you just need a long Ethernet cable from your Virgin router (which needs to be in modem mode) to wherever you want your new boujee router. For a ~6 person house, this may be enough in terms of spending, but for a bigger house, you may need to buy an additional Wireless Access Point, or WAP, to cover any gaps in the WiFi coverage (we‚Äôve got one for the two rooms at the back of the ground floor).  
  
A WAP is like a step up from one of the shite wifi extenders that Virgin may have recommend you. They‚Äôre shit because they work either by picking up a ‚Äústrong‚Äù signal and repeating it (but the signal isn‚Äôt strong enough in the right places for this to work usually), or by sending internet signals over the houses power wiring (powerline adapters/homeplugs). The electrical wiring in Selly houses is most likely made of tin foil and paperclips so this also isn‚Äôt going to work very well. Running a 10 or 20m Ethernet cable along the wall with cable clips and putting a WAP on the end will give you the best results for the money. Note that you need another long ethernet cable to connect the access point, and this needs to connect to the new router, NOT the Virgin hub.  
  
Finally, you may be familiar with 5GHz WiFi (NOT 5G). This is basically a newer, faster WiFi standard, with the caveat that it‚Äôs shorter range - but there‚Äôs less interference from things like microwaves and the neighbour‚Äôs WiFi, and if you have a router + a Wireless Access Point placed strategically in the house, you should be able to cover the whole of the house with lovely 5GHz WiFi. Most routers broadcast a 5GHz signal (even the Virgin shitbox) and also have the older, slower but longer range 2.4GHz signal broadcasting under the same name. The client device (phone, laptop etc) ‚Äúchooses‚Äù the best signal but in reality this never happens, it‚Äôs best to set them up as separate networks (e.g. House Wifi and House Wifi 5Ghz), and then choose the 5Ghz one where possible. The only reason to use the non-5GHz one is if the device doesn‚Äôt support it (e.g. old Alexa devices, smart lights etc) or if range is an issue but it shouldn‚Äôt be. We also have separate names for the main router and the Wireless Access Point in our house and just connect to the closest one. You could buy two of the TP-Link routers and put one in WAP mode, and then use TP-Link's "OneMesh" feature to seamlessly move between routers/WAPs, but I can't vouch for this as I haven't used it.

#### So, to summarise:

-   Buy a new router cause the Virgin one is shit
-   Position the new router in a central position in the house, connect with a long Ethernet cable
-   If you have a big house, get a Wireless Access Point too (recommendation below) and connect it with another Ethernet cable
-   Use 5Ghz WiFi where you can, and give it a separate name to the 2.4GHz WiFi

Thank you for coming to my TED talk

I realise this is quite complicated and I may not have done the best job explaining it so feel free to drop me a message and I‚Äôll see if I can help (Joe Tebbett on Facebook). Also for any other geeks, if I‚Äôve got something wrong please do let me know lol. The stuff we got in our house cost about ¬£130 total as of time of writing, between 8 that‚Äôs ¬£16.25 which is admittedly quite a lot but it‚Äôs worth it to get the speeds you‚Äôre paying Virgin for, even if it should be included with the contract in an ideal world. 
  
### Shopping List
I recommend using Amazon as you can return things if they don't work for you, which is what I did with a couple of devices before I settled on this setup
